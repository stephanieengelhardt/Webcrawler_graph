After running /wiki/Computer_Science as the seedUrl, 200 as the max, an empty list as the topics, and then made it into a graph (in WikiCS.txt), we got the following results:
The vertex /wiki/Computer_Science has the max out degree and max centrality
	The max centrality= 9773
	The max out degree = 199
Number of edges in the graph = 2865
Number of vertices in the graph = 200
The diameter of the graph is= 5

The data structure we used for Q is a linked list. The java linked list implementations gives O(1) time for add and poll which are the only methods used with the queue.

The data structure used for visited was an ArrayList.
