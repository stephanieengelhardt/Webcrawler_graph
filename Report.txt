After running /wiki/Computer_Science as the seedUrl, 200 as the max, an empty list as the topics, and then made it into a graph (in WikiCS.txt), we got the following results:
The vertex /wiki/Computer_Science has the max out degree and max centrality
	The max centrality= 9773
	The max out degree = 199
Number of edges in the graph = 2865
Number of vertices in the graph = 200
The diameter of the graph is= 5
